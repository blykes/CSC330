Screen Shot Where We Used DRY
What did you guys as a whole learn from doing this assignment?
Is the code configurable?
Is it maintainable? Like sweet and simple?
Why do you use files because it seems it doesn't seem like a DRY representation?
^ We have more control and it's manageable for us as the creators.
Is it readable?
Can it be understood by others who don't know how to read code?
