What did you guys as a whole learn from doing this assignment?

Is the code configurable? - yes but since this is an early version things would have to adapted 
  for something like a database to be more configurable than it is now. We as the creators can maitian and manafge the code. 
  
Is it maintainable? Like sweet and simple? Yes. Each method is maintainable, easy to read and can be easily understood by other programmers

Why do you use files because it seems it doesn't seem like a DRY representation? 
^ We have more control and it's manageable for us as the creators and easily converted to database.

Is it readable? yes. its writtenin simple terms. 

Can it be understood by others who don't know how to read code? Yes. It can be followed and the objects are neamed appropriately
